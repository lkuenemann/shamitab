Introduction:
*************
The shamitab format is an attempt to define a shamisen tablature encoding format. The tablature is encoded in terms of "symbols", where one symbol is an single element (bar, silence, single note, chord, etc.) of the tablature. Symbols are atomic units of the shamitab format, encoding all the possible properties a shamisen tablature element could hold on 32 bits.

In the shamitab format, all symbols on the tablature are encoded one by one in order, from first to last. A shamitab file begins with a magic number, and ends with an end of file (EOF) marker (see file markers section).

The shamitab format makes a distinction between normal symbols (notes and chords), and special symbols (silence, bar, repeat symbol). The encoding is defined as follows, with the 32 bits broken down into 9 components:

	0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
	AAAB CDDD EFFF PPGH HHHH GHHH HHGH HHHH

* A codes the duration of the symbol
* B codes the presence of a triplet
* C codes the presence of a slide
* D codes the effect type
* E codes the mae bachi play style
* F codes the finger annotation
* P is some padding (2 unused bits set to 0)
* G codes the presence of a note on associated string
* H codes the position of this note on associated string

G and H are repeated 3 times, one for each string of the shamisen. They are, in order, G1 and H1 for the 1st string (ichi no ito, the lowest string), G2 and H2 for the 2nd strng (ni no ito, the middle string), and G3 and H3 for the 3rd string (san no ito, the highest string).

Each G indicates that a note is played on its associated string. A single G being positive would mean a single note, multiple Gs being positive would mean a chord, and no G being positive would mean no note is played. This latter case is used to encode special symbols.


Special symbols:
****************
Symbols are special symbols when G1, G2, and G3 all together hold the value 0.

The defined special symbols are:
* Silence
* Bar
* Double bar
* Left repeat (start of a repeat section)
* Right repeat (end of a repeat section)

Special symbols are coded by D in the following manner:
+---------+--------------+
| D value | Symbol       |
+---------+--------------+
| 000     | Silence      |
| 001     | Bar          |
| 010     | Double bar   |
| 011     | Left repeat  |
| 100     | Right repeat |
| Other   | Undefined    |
+---------+--------------+

By convention, all other bits should be set to 0 with the exception of A for a silence, where it should be encoding its duration using the definition given in "Normal symbols" section, "A: duration" sub-section.


Normal symbols:
***************
Symbols are normal when at least one of G1, G2, or G3 holds the value 1.

	A: duration
A encodes the duration of a note or chord. It is defined as follows:
+---------+-------------------+
| A value | Duration in beats |
+---------+-------------------+
| 000     | 4                 |
| 001     | 2                 |
| 010     | 1                 |
| 011     | 1/2               |
| 100     | 1/4               |
| 101     | 1/8               |
| 110     | 1/16              |
| 111     | 1/32              |
+---------+-------------------+

	B: triplet
A note is part of a triplet when B is 1. The note is not otherwise.

	C: slide
A note is part of a slide when C is 1. The note is not otherwise.

	D: effect
D encodes the type of effect the note (or chord) is played with. 4 effects are defined:
* Hajiki (pull-off)
* Uchi (hammer-on)
* Sukui (playing by pulling the bachi up)
* Suberi (sliding the bachi onto the string from the lower one)

The encoding is defined as:
+---------+-----------+
| D value | Effect    |
+---------+-----------+
| 000     | No effect |
| 001     | Hajiki    |
| 010     | Uchi      |
| 011     | Sukui     |
| 100     | Suberi    |
| Other   | Undefined |
+---------+-----------+

	E: mae bachi
A note is played in mae bachi when E is 1. Otherwise, the note is played in ushiro bachi (assumed as the normal play style here).

	F: finger
Encodes the indication of which finger to use to play the note. Encoding is defined as:
+---------+--------------+---------------+
| F value | Usual marker | Finger        |
+---------+--------------+---------------+
| 000     | None         | No indication |
| 001     | I            | Index finger  |
| 010     | II           | Middle finger |
| 011     | III          | Ring finger   |
| 100     | IV           | Pinky         |
| Other   | Undefined    | Undefined     |
+---------+--------------+---------------+

	G: note played
When G is 1, a note is played on the corresponding string, and its position on the sao (neck) is encoded by the associated H that follows. From MSB (most significant bit) to LSB (least significant bit), we have in order: G1, H1, G2, H2, G3, then H3. G1 encodes a note for the 1st string (ichi no ito, lowest), G2 for the 2nd string (ni no ito, middle), and G3 for the 3rd string (san no ito, highest).

	H: position of the note
The position of the note is directly coded in standard binary from 00000 (position 0, open string) to 11111 (position 31 on the neck), despite a shamisen neck usually going only up to around 20. H1 encodes the position on the 1st string, H2 on the 2nd string, and H3 on the 3rd string (similar to G sub-section above). By convention, when G is 0 (no note played on associated string), corresponding H should be set to 0.


File markers:
*************
Shamitab files all begin with the magic number 0x334d5421 (ASCII for 3MT!).
Shamitab files are all ending with an end of file (EOF) marker 0xFFFFFFFF (all 32 bits set to 1).
